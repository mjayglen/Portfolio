- Filterable list of skills and tags.
- Certificate section with issued date and issuer.
- Dark and light theme with CSS variables.
- Image optimization and preloading for key assets.
- Simple content management via JSON or markdown.

Setup ‚Äî developer mode
1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mjayglen/Portfolio.git
cd Portfolio
```
2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
# or
pnpm install
# or
yarn
```
3. Run local dev server
```bash
npm run dev
```
- Vite serves the app with HMR. Open the URL Vite prints in the terminal.

Build and serve production
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```
- `build` creates a production-ready `dist/`.
- `preview` serves the `dist/` locally for a final check.

Release artifacts
- Visit the Releases page: https://github.com/mjayglen/Portfolio/releases
- Download the release asset (for example, portfolio-v1.0.0.zip).
- Extract the archive and execute the provided start script:
```bash
unzip portfolio-v1.0.0.zip
cd portfolio
# if a start script is provided:
chmod +x start.sh
./start.sh
# or serve the folder:
npx http-server ./dist -p 8080
```
- The release includes a ready-to-serve static build and a short README with the asset name and recommended run steps.

Design and UI notes
- Component-based design. Each page uses a small set of reusable components:
  - Header / Nav
  - ProjectCard
  - SkillList
  - CertCard
  - Footer
- CSS uses variables for theme values. Use a single source of truth for colors and spacing.
- Use prefers-reduced-motion for animations when possible.

Accessibility (a11y)
- Use semantic tags: header, main, nav, section, footer.
- Provide alt text for images and aria-labels for interactive controls.
- Ensure contrast meets WCAG AA for body text.
- Keyboard navigation for focusable elements.

Performance
- Use Vite‚Äôs ES module dev server for small rebuilds.
- Use code splitting for large libraries and dynamic imports for optional sections.
- Preload hero image and critical CSS.
- Defer non-critical scripts and use native lazy loading for below-the-fold images.

Folder structure (example)
- public/           // static assets, favicon, robots.txt

Content model
- Projects:
  - id, title, description, tech[], repo, live, image
- Skills:
  - name, level, category, years
- Certifications:
  - title, issuer, date, link, badgeImage

Deployment
- Build outputs static assets. Deploy to:
  - GitHub Pages
  - Vercel
  - Netlify
  - Any static host
- Example: deploy to GitHub Pages
```bash
npm run build
# push the contents of dist/ to gh-pages branch, or use a deploy action
```

Testing and linting
- Add ESLint and Prettier for consistent style.
- Run unit tests for key components where logic is non-trivial.
- Check CI pipeline to ensure build passes on push.

Customization guide
- Replace projects in src/data/projects.json with your own work.
- Update skills and certs files.
- Swap hero image in public/hero.jpg.
- Edit color variables in src/styles/variables.css to match your brand.

Contributing
- Use clear, focused PRs.
- Add tests for new logic.
- Keep changes small and documented in the PR description.
- Use the issue tracker for feature requests or bug reports.

Badges and SEO
- Add Open Graph tags in index.html for better previews.
- Use descriptive titles and meta descriptions per page.
- Keep headings semantic and unique per section.

Common commands
- npm run dev     # start dev server
- npm run build   # build production
- npm run preview # preview build
- npm test        # run tests (if configured)
- npm run lint    # run linters

Troubleshooting

```bash
npx kill-port 5173
npm run dev
```
